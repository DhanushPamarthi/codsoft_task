# TIC-TAC-TOE AI

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe AI project! In this project, we'll be implementing an AI agent that takes on the challenge of playing the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. By leveraging algorithms like Minimax (with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning), we aim to create an AI player that is virtually unbeatable. This endeavor offers a valuable opportunity to delve into game theory and grasp fundamental search algorithms.

## Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet engaging two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty cells with their respective symbols (traditionally 'X' and 'O') to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbols. The player who achieves this first wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Our project's focus is on crafting an AI agent capable of making intelligent moves during the game. The AI's moves will be guided by the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making process that assesses potential future game states to determine the best possible move. Optionally, we can enhance the efficiency of the Minimax algorithm by implementing Alpha-Beta Pruning, which further trims down unnecessary computations.

## Features

Human vs. AI Gameplay**: Engage in an intriguing showdown against an AI opponent that employs strategic moves.
Unbeatable AI**: By employing the Minimax algorithm, the AI is geared to become exceptionally difficult to defeat.
Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optional implementation of Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize the AI's decision-making process.
Insight into Game Theory**: Gain insights into fundamental concepts of game theory and search algorithms through hands-on implementation.
Simple User Interface**: Experience the game's interface through the command line, making it easy to focus on gameplay and AI strategy.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the game and select the game mode (human vs. AI).
4. Challenge the AI to a game of Tic-Tac-Toe!

## Implementation Details

The AI's intelligence comes from the Minimax algorithm. It simulates all possible moves and counter-moves, creating a game tree that extends to a certain depth. For each possible move, the algorithm assigns a score indicating the desirability of that move for the AI player. By selecting the move with the highest score, the AI aims to maximize its chances of winning.

Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization technique that minimizes the number of evaluated nodes in the Minimax tree. It works by realizing that if a certain move leads to a position that is worse for the AI than a previously evaluated move, the AI would never choose that move. Consequently, the algorithm can safely ignore the remaining moves in that branch of the tree.

## Future Enhancements

This project can be a starting point for further innovations:

- **Enhanced AI Heuristics**: Develop advanced heuristics to augment the AI's decision-making capabilities and make it even more challenging.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Expand the user interface to a graphical form for a visually appealing gameplay experience.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Incorporate multiplayer functionality, allowing players to compete against each other.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Explore integrating machine learning techniques to train the AI, enabling it to adapt and learn from various playstyles.
